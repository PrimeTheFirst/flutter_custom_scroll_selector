Feel free to change the code, make it more efficient, as speed and power is not something this project prioritizes. You can download the project/copy the main.dart file and change the selector as per your needs. Make it prettier and maybe even push those changes. Might make a package of it later. The code is fairly simple, and comments have been left where necessary.
